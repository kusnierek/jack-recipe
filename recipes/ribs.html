        <li>2 tablespoons freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon ground cumin</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dry mustard</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground cayenne pepper</li>

        <li>1 rack baby back pork ribs</li>
        <li>1 cup barbeque sauce</li>
    </ul>

  <h3>Steps</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 250 degrees F (120 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Mix ancho chile powder, white sugar, brown sugar, salt, black pepper, cumin, dry mustard, cayenne pepper, and chipotle pepper in a small bowl until combined.</li>
        <li>Place ribs meat-side down on aluminum foil. Prick back of rib rack several times with a knife.</li>
        <li>Generously apply coating of dry rub to all sides of rib rack.</li>
        <li>With rib rack meat-side down, fold foil around it to create a tight seal. Transfer to sheet pan.</li>
        <li>Bake in preheated oven until tender and cooked through, about 2 hours. Remove and cool 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Increase oven temperature to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Open foil, drain and discard any accumulated juices and fat. Brush barbeque sauce on all sides of rack.</li>
        <li>Place rack meat-side up and return to oven, leaving foil open. Bake for 10 minutes, remove from oven, and brush another layer of barbeque sauce on meat-side only. Repeat baking and brushing with sauce 4 more times, for a total of 50 minutes baking time.</li>
        <li>Cut rack into individual rib segments and serve with more barbeque sauce.</li>
      </ol>
